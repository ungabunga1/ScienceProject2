these jsons are the result of an unpickle function made in python, not java.

these are unpickled versions of the files downloaded from the cifar read me html.

an addition to the json files have been made from their orignal unpickled versions,
an array of strings has been added under the key "labelNames". The array is constant between
all jsons and is used to determine the names of the labels

even though the result of the function is included, the function itself is not.
